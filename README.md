# AutoHotkey-Automation

AutoHotkey is a simple, free, open-source software for Windows automation that helps to perform simple actions to complex tasks.

Goal:
AutoHotkey (AHK) script to wait for its execution till all the previously started scripts are finished. This allows scripts to run one at a time so trying to execute a new script do not interrupt any previously running scripts. Find the scripts test.ahk and wait_run.ahk from the source and try running them at the same time. You will find wait_run.ahk waiting for test.ahk to finish to start its execution.

Let's do this:
Download and install AutoHotkey - https://www.autohotkey.com/download

To start the script:
You can create AHK scripts using any text editor. Write the script in text editor and save it as .ahk file. Having AutoHotkey installed, right click the AHK file and select “Run Script” or simply double-click the AHK file to run it. While a script is running you’ll find the AutoHotkey’s green H icon in the taskbar.

To end the script:If you have control of the keyboard and mouse, you can end the script at any point by right-clicking the green H icon in the taskbar and selecting “Exit”
